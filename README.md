### User Research
The user research, based on competitive analysis, personas, and user flows, revealed the following key insights:
- Users prioritize simplicity, speed, and clear visual cues for identifying toppings and pizzas.
- Preventing errors and ensuring accessibility (e.g., avoiding duplicates) are critical. These insights shaped the design to ensure an efficient, seamless user experience.
### Manage Toppings UI
#### Design Decisions and Rationale
- The Manage Toppings page is organized into a grid layout, displaying each topping’s image, name, and price, allowing the pizza store owner to quickly distinguish and manage toppings.
- A dedicated “Stock Status” filter helps efficiently manage inventory by showing available toppings.
- The “Quick Add” feature simplifies the process of adding new toppings, reducing management friction.
- The “Delete Item” option empowers the owner to remove toppings, giving them complete control over the inventory.
- The “Replace Image” feature allows the owner to update topping images, ensuring the interface reflects current offerings.
### User Experience Considerations
- **Accessibility:** Clear text labels and high-contrast design elements ensure accessibility for users with varying visual abilities.
- **Feedback:** The system provides immediate feedback when a duplicate topping is entered, preventing errors and maintaining data integrity.
- **Scalability:** The grid layout is designed to accommodate a growing number of toppings without compromising usability.
- **Efficiency:** Visual cues, quick-add functionality, and deletion options streamline topping management, saving time and effort.

### Manage Pizzas UI
#### Design Decisions and Rationale
- The “Manage Pizzas” page uses the same grid layout of the Manage Toppings page, ensuring a consistent experience across both sections.
- Each pizza’s name, image, and price are clearly displayed for easy overview.
- The Toppings section for each pizza allows the chef to quickly see the toppings for each variation.
- The “Delete Item” option gives the chef control over the pizza menu.
#### User Experience Considerations
- **Consistency:** The design maintains layout and interaction consistency with the Manage Toppings page, ensuring a unified experience.
- **Feedback:** The system prevents errors by providing feedback when a duplicate pizza name is entered.
- **Customization:** The ability to replace pizza images enhances branding and visual appeal, offering tailored representations of the pizza menu.
- **Efficiency:** The organized layout and streamlined topping management enhance the chef’s productivity, enabling quick pizza creation and editing.
